## Understanding Files

1. [Clustering]_Submission_Akhir_BMLP_Muhammad_Hafizh_Dzaki.ipynb : Notebook designed to perform the clustering task and analyzed the results. This notebook used the input <u>Ship_Performance_Dataset_Inisiasi.csv</u> and outputed a csv file named <u>Ship_Performance_Dataset_Clustering.csv</u> for further classification.
2. [Klasifikasi]_Submission_Akhir_BMLP_Muhammad_Hafizh_Dzaki.ipynb : Notebook designed to perform the classification task from previous clustering task. This notebook used the input <u>Ship_Performance_Dataset_Clustering.csv</u>.
3. Ship_Performance_Dataset_Clustering.csv : Csv file contains row of data with cluster pretended as its label.
4. Ship_Performance_Dataset_Inisiasi.csv : Initial csv file.
